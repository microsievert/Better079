#### With this plugin, SCP-079 will be able to:
- SCP-079 will see on the minimap all people in its area, not just SCP objects.
- SCP-079 will be able to turn off the lights throughout the complex by sacrificing a certain amount of energy for this action using ``.overcharge time`` command.
- SCP-079 will now be able to protect itself from restarting generators using the ``.overload`` console command, which will instantly cause a spectacular power outage and turn off only those generators that are currently charging.
- SCP-079 will now be able to simulate some cassies with glitches using ``.simulate cassieid`` command. Custom cassies for play as SCP-079 should be added in config
- SCP-079 will be able to teleport to random player using ``.find`` command.
- SCP-2176 will damage SCP-079. When SCP-2176 explodes in special rooms (rooms should be writed in config) SCP-079 lost all energy and gets critical camera system errors to ~6 seconds.
- This plugin allows you to set the initial Tier for SCP-079 or automatically issue any tier after any length of time.
